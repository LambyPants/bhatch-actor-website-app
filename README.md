This is professional portfolio full-stack web application built for actor Brian Hatch. It includes a backend Node.js interface which allows the client to edit, create, and destroy all site content himself (all media, links, announcements, quotes, etc).

All CRUD routes and the backend interface are protected through authentication middleware and Passport -- accessible by the client only after he has logged in.
